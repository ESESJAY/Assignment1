Assignment1_S10220988:
I am doing a website for Yoasobi. Yoasobi is a duo Japanese band that comprises of a Vocaloid producer, Ayase, and a singer-songwriter, Ikura. I found the band pretty underrated for their great quality of music and so I am making a website for them to share Yoasobi’s songs with anyone who loves Japanese genre music. I created a home, profile, songs and albums, biography, and a shop page for the website that I am creating. Users can find out more about the band’s story, songs, merchandise, and even ticket details for the upcoming concerts that the bands are performing at on the website.
